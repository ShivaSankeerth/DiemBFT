# Description

This Project is an implementation of Diem Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DiemBFT) algorithmic core and discusses the consensus protocol which is responsible for forming agreement on ordering and finalizing transactions among a configurable set of validators. Here's the algorithmic core of the Diem Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DiemBFT) consensus algorithm:

1. Choose a random validator to be the leader for the current round.
2. The leader proposes a block of transactions and sends it to all other validators.
3. Each validator receives the proposed block and performs the following steps:
   - Verify that the block is correctly formatted and includes a valid cryptographic signature from the leader.
   - Check that the transactions in the block are valid and do not conflict with any previously processed transactions.
   - Broadcast a "pre-vote" message to all other validators indicating that they have validated the block.
4. Once a supermajority (two-thirds) of validators have sent pre-votes for the block, the leader sends a "pre-commit" message to all validators indicating that they should commit to the proposed block.
5. Each validator receives the pre-commit message and performs the following steps:
   - Verify that the message is correctly formatted and includes a valid cryptographic signature from the leader.
   - Broadcast a "commit" message to all other validators indicating that they have committed to the block.
6. Once a supermajority of validators have sent commit messages for the block, the block is added to the blockchain and the next round begins with a new random leader.

The use of pre-votes and pre-commits in the DiemBFT algorithm is intended to prevent "last-minute" changes to the proposed block by the leader, as well as to ensure that all validators are in agreement before committing to a block. This helps to prevent attacks on the network and ensure that consensus is reached efficiently and reliably.



# Platform

DistAlgo version - 1.1.0b15
Python implementation - CPython
Python version - 3.7.10

## Workload generation

Client workload distribution is being generated in `test_suite.py`. We are generating the list of client messages per node-id with seperate configurable parameters. This file can be modified to include more test cases or modify existing test cases as ncesseary. There are also hyperparameteres present within the `main.da` file which control the main configurable parameters.

## Timeouts

Local timeouts - Local timeouts within nodes generating timeout messages with timeout information, last round timeout certificate (if present), high commit QC (highest QC that serves as a commit certificate), Pacemaker maintains round times in order to advance rounds and maintains liveness. Generates TC if conditions are met. 

## Main files

 - main.da - contains code for the main module for clients & replicas. Also includes initialization parameters. 
 - blockTree.da - contains module that generates proposal blocks. It keeps track of a tree of blocks pending commitment with votes and QCâ€™s on them.
 - safety.da - contains module that implements the core consensus safety rules.
 - pacemaker.da - contains module that maintains the liveness and advances rounds.
 - mempool.da - contains module that provides transactions to the leader when generating proposals.
 - leaderElection.da - contains module that maps rounds to leaders and achieves optimal leader utilization under static crash faults while maintaining chain quality under Byzantine faults.
 - ledger.da - contains module that creates ledger represenations and stores/updates within the path. 

## Language feature usage

- List comprehensions - 5
- Dictionary comprehensions - 3
- Await statements - Awaiting until expression becomes true or has a timeout after T seconds. 1
- Receive handlers - Used to receive messages and act upon by topic. 1
